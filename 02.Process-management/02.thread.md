# Thread 


## Concept
Have you ever used a program running several tasks at the same time? for example a music player, it plays the music and in the same time it shows notification and displays recommendations. All of these tasks happen concurrently not sequentially. Also, the music player process is not utilizing another processes for other tasks but performs several tasks at the same by it-self. This can be achieved via threads. 

A `thread` is a unit of execution. Every process has at least one thread to get executed. You can think of the thread as an execution arrow that reads instructions one after the other.
Having more than one thread in a single process means more independent execution units that can run concurrently at the same time.

Threads are a small execution units inside of a process, and they share some resources as described in the image below.

### Thread States (Draft)
Threads generally have the same states as processes.

Thread states:
- **New** : new thread have been created.
- **Ready** : the thread is ready for execution.
- **Running** : the thread is running.
- **Waiting** : the thread us waiting.
- **Terminated** : thread have been terminated.


## Code 
To handle threads, we will be working with `Thead` class and its related classes and interfaces.

### Create a Thread

Create a program that runs the `date` process and display its output.
```java

```

### Read a Thread

```java

```

### Terminate a Thread

```java

```
