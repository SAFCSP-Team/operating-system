# File Management 
As explained earlier, we can manage files in the computer using the syscalls operating system provides. It will allows us to read, write, update, and delete files. Let us have some examples to each operation in C. 


## Example
In C, to access files functionalities, you will need to create a `FILE` pointer to point to the file we are working with and perform operations on it. Let us have a simple example of opening a file before doing anything else. 

### Open a file
To open a file, we will use `fopen` function as the following. 
> Note, our project has two files in the same level (directory). The `open.c` and `file.txt`. To open `file.txt` from our C program, we will have the following code in `open.c`.
```c
#include <stdio.h>


int main(){
    FILE* fptr; // Create FILE pointer

    // fopen( <file-path>, <mode>);
    fptr = fopen("file.txt","r"); //r: read mode

    if(fptr != NULL){
        printf("File opened successfully! \n");
    }else{
        perror("There was an issue opening the file \n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

output
```
File opened successfully!
```
Since the code is correct, the output displayed is `File opened successfully!`. Lets change the file name to an incorrect name for checking if it will open it or display the error message above.

```c
#include <stdio.h>


int main(){
    FILE* fptr;

    // fopen( <file-path>, <mode>);
    fptr = fopen("wrong.txt","r"); //r: read mode

    if(fptr != NULL){
        printf("File opened successfully! \n");
    }else{
        perror("There was an issue opening the file \n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
output
```
There was an issue opening the file 
: No such file or directory
```

`fopen` function has the following modes to open a file.
| Mode     | Description                                      |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `"r"`    | Read (text), open the file for reading. |
| `"w"`    | Write (text), if the file does not exist, it will create it. If exist, it will overwrite its content. |
| `"a"`    | Append (text), append a text to the file content. |
| `"rb"`   | Read (binary) |
| `"wb"`   | Write (binary) |
| `"ab"`   | Append (binary) |
| `"r+"` or `rb+` or `r+b`   | Read and write (open a file for update by reading or writing without descarding previous data) |
| `"w+"` or `wb+` or `w+b`   | Read and write (discards existing data) |
| `"a+"` or `ab+` or `a+b`   | Read and append |

### Close a file 
After accessing any file, you should close the connection to remove the overhead of maintaining the file from the OS.

```c
#include <stdio.h>


int main(){
    FILE* fptr;

    fptr = fopen("file.txt","r");

    if(fptr != NULL){
        printf("File opened successfully! \n");
        fclose(fptr); // close the file
    }else{
        perror("There was an issue opening the file \n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

output
```
File opened successfully!
```

You can also have an if statement to check the return value from `fclose`, if equal to `0` then the file has been closed successfully. Else, indicate that an error ocurred during the closing of the file.

```c
#include <stdio.h>


int main(){
    FILE* fptr;

    fptr = fopen("file.txt","r");

    if(fptr == NULL) { // If NULL then exit with error of opening the file.
        perror("There was an issue opening the file \n");
        return -1;
    }

    printf("File opened successfully! \n");


    if(fclose(fptr) != 0){ // If not equal to 0 then exit with error of closing the file.
        perror("Error while closing the file\n");
        return -1;
    }
        printf("File closed successfully! \n");

    return 0;
}

```
> Note: we added some changes to the code.

output
```
File opened successfully! 
File closed successfully!
```

### Read 
To read the content of out text file, we will use the `r` mode for reading and `fgets` function to read each line of the text file as the following.
code
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    FILE* fptr;

    fptr = fopen("file.txt","r"); //r: read mode

    if(fptr == NULL){
        perror("Error ocurred while opening the file.");
        return -1;
    }
    // Read every line in the text file
    char line[256]; // Act as a buffer to hold every 256 character
    fgets(line, sizeof(line), fptr);

    // Print the content
    printf("%s\n", line);

    fclose(fptr);

    return 0;
}
```

output
```
Hello, this is my file to work with.
```

### Write
To write into a file, we will use `w` mode to indicate writing mode. And `fprintf` function to write a text into out file.
code

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    FILE* fptr;

    fptr = fopen("file.txt","w"); //w: write mode

    if(fptr == NULL){
        perror("There was an issue opening the file \n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Write into the file
    fprintf(fptr, "Hello from my C program!\nBy DEV");

    fclose(fptr);
    return 0;
}
```

file.txt content
```
Hello from my C program!
By DEV
```

### Read and Write
We can combine both read and write functionalities on a file by using `w+` or `r+` for indicating reading and writing modes. 

> Note: `w+` will discard old content of the file wile `r+` will not discard it. Be aware to which one you will use.

code
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    FILE* fptr;

    fptr = fopen("file.txt","w+"); //w: write mode

    if(fptr == NULL){
        perror("There was an issue opening the file \n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Write into the file
    fprintf(fptr, "Hello from my C program!\nBy DEV");

    rewind(fptr); // Move the file pointer (position of an arrow in the file) to the start for reading now
    
    char line[256];
    fgets(line, sizeof(line), fptr );
    printf("%s", line);

    fclose(fptr);
    return 0;
}
```

output
```
Hello from my C program!
```

file.txt content 
```
Hello from my C program!
By DEV
```

As you can see, only the first line was printed. However, we want to print the complete content of the file. To do so, we will include `fgets` in a loop to print each line until the content is completed.

code 
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    FILE* fptr;

    fptr = fopen("file.txt","w+"); //w: write mode

    if(fptr == NULL){
        perror("There was an issue opening the file \n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Write into the file
    fprintf(fptr, "Hello from my C program!\nBy DEV");

    rewind(fptr); // Move the file pointer (position of an arrow in the file) to the start for reading now
    
    char line[256];
    while(fgets(line, sizeof(line), fptr )){
        printf("%s", line);
    }

    fclose(fptr);
    return 0;
}
```

output
```
Hello from my C program!
By DEV
```

### Update
To update the content of a file, we can use `a` which is the append mode, it will help us append a text to the file content (you can also use `w` to write into the file completely). 

code
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    FILE* fptr;

    fptr = fopen("file.txt","a"); //w: write mode

    if(fptr == NULL){
        perror("There was an issue opening the file \n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Write into the file
    fprintf(fptr, "\nDeveloper");

    fclose(fptr);
    return 0;
}
```

file.txt content **before** running the code
```
Hello, please add your name below.
```

file.txt content **after** running the code
```
Hello, please add your name below.
Developer
```


### Delete
To delete a file, we will pass the file name to `remove` function as the following.

code
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    
    if (remove("file.txt") == 0) {
        printf("File deleted successfully.\n");
    } else {
        perror("Error deleting the file");
        return -1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

output
```
File deleted successfully.
```
