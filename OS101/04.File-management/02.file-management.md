# File Management 
As explained earlier, we can manage files in the computer using the syscalls operating system provides. It will allows us to read, write, update, and delete files. Let us have some examples to each operation in C. 


## Example
In C, to access files functionalities, you will need to create a `FILE` pointer to point to the file we are working with and perform operations on it. Let us have a simple example of opening a file before doing anything else. 

### Open a file
To open a file, we will use `fopen` function as the following. 
> Note, our project has two files in the same level (directory). The `open.c` and `file.txt`. To open `file.txt` from our C program, we will have the following code in `open.c`.
```c
#include <stdio.h>


int main(){
    FILE* fptr; // Create FILE pointer

    // fopen( <File-Path>, <Options>);
    fptr = fopen("file.txt","r"); //r: read mode

    if(fptr != NULL){
        printf("File opened successfully! \n");
    }else{
        perror("There was an issue opening the file \n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

output
```
File opened successfully!
```
Since the code is correct, the output displayed is `File opened successfully!`. Lets change the file name to an incorrect name for checking if it will open it or display the error message above.

```c
#include <stdio.h>


int main(){
    FILE* fptr;

    // fopen( <File-Path>, <Options>);
    fptr = fopen("wrong.txt","r"); //r: read mode

    if(fptr != NULL){
        printf("File opened successfully! \n");
    }else{
        perror("There was an issue opening the file \n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
output
```
There was an issue opening the file 
: No such file or directory
```

### Close a file 
After accessing any file, you should close the connection to remove the overhead of maintaining the file from the OS.

```c
#include <stdio.h>


int main(){
    FILE* fptr;

    fptr = fopen("file.txt","r");

    if(fptr != NULL){
        printf("File opened successfully! \n");
        fclose(fptr); // close the file
    }else{
        perror("There was an issue opening the file \n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

output
```
File opened successfully!
```

You can also have an if statement to check the return value from `fclose`, if equal to `0` then the file has been closed successfully. Else, indicate that an error ocurred during the closing of the file.

```c
#include <stdio.h>


int main(){
    FILE* fptr;

    fptr = fopen("file.txt","r");

    if(fptr == NULL) { // If NULL then exit with error of opening the file.
        perror("There was an issue opening the file \n");
        return -1;
    }

    printf("File opened successfully! \n");


    if(fclose(fptr) != 0){ // If not equal to 0 then exit with error of closing the file.
        perror("Error while closing the file\n");
        return -1;
    }
        printf("File closed successfully! \n");

    return 0;
}

```
> Note: we added some changes to the code.

output
```
File opened successfully! 
File closed successfully!
```
