# Process Management through Programming Language
Since we have seen how can we manage processes throug the use of GUI and Command Line, we will now look into how its managed through a programming language such as C or Java. 


## Process Management Code
Let us look into some examples in C indecating how to access syscalls that are described earlier for process management.

### Process Management Syscalls
There are some header files that can be used to access syscalls such as,
```c
#include <unistd.h>  // For fork(), exec(), getpid(), etc.
#include <sys/types.h> // For data types used in syscalls
#include <sys/wait.h>  // For wait() and waitpid()
#include <signal.h>     // For signal handling
```

Lets have an example of creating a simple C program printing `Hello World` and try to modify it to use syscalls. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}
```

output
```
Hello World
```

#### Create a Process
to create a process, we will use `fork()` syscall, to do so, we will need to include `#include <unistd.h>`.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(){
    fork();
    printf("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}
```

output
```
Hello World
Hello World
```
The output got duplicated since the current program/process has been duplicated using the fork syscall and then executed.

The fork returns a number of the process id, we can store it in an `int` datatype, or we can use `sys/types` and use `pid_t` as the type of the process id.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main(){
    pid_t pid = fork();
    printf("Hello World\n");
    printf("PID: %d\n",pid);
    return 0;
}
```

output
```
Hello World
PID: 35638
Hello World
PID: 0
```

The values returned by the fork has meaning as follows. 
- Positive Value: If `fork()` returns a positive value, this value is the Process ID (PID) of the child process. It indicates that you are in the parent process.
- Zero (0): If `fork()` returns 0, this means you are in the child process.
- Negative Value: If `fork()` returns a negative value (usually -1), it indicates that the process creation failed.

With the help of the returned pid value, we can write a program that execute some code if the child process is running, and another for the parent process. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main(){
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if(pid == 0 ){
        printf("Hello from child process\n");
    }else{
        printf("Hello from parent process\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

output
```
Hello from parent process
Hello from child process
```
#### Read a Process
Reading a process means accessing the process data such as its id.
Lets have an example of reading child and parent processes ids.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main(){
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if(pid == 0 ){
        printf("Hello from child process\n");
        printf("PID: %d\n", getpid());
        printf("PPID: %d\n", getppid());
    }else{
        printf("Hello from parent process\n");
        printf("PID: %d\n", getpid());
        printf("PPID: %d\n", getppid());
        // sleep(2);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

output 
```
Hello from parent process
PID: 38542
PPID: 1120
Hello from child process
PID: 38543
PPID: 1
```

The ppid of the child process is the parent process id, which should have been 38542. Why did the output became 1? 
As you can see, the parent process has executed and terminated before the child. Therefore, when the child process runs and try to print its ppid, it can not find it. Its parent has just been terminated. But, with what we know about the process tree is that each process should have a parent, so when a child process looses its parent it becomes orphan. And orphan processes are typically adopted by the root process (i.e. init) which has the id of 1.

To be able to print the correct ppid, we will make the parent process sleep a bit to make sure it does not terminate before the child process as the following.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main(){
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if(pid == 0 ){
        printf("Hello from child process\n");
        printf("PID: %d\n", getpid());
        printf("PPID: %d\n", getppid());
    }else{
        printf("Hello from parent process\n");
        printf("PID: %d\n", getpid());
        printf("PPID: %d\n", getppid());
        sleep(2);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

output
```
Hello from parent process
PID: 38737
PPID: 1120
Hello from child process
PID: 38738
PPID: 38737
```

Now we notice, the PPID of the child process is the same as the PID of our program since it did not exit.

#### Terminate a Process
To terminate a process, you must identify if you are terminating the current process you are in, or another process (such as a child process).


To terminate the current process you can use `exit()` function as the following example. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // To call exit()

int main() {
    printf("This process will be terminated now.\n");
    exit(0); // Terminate with exit status 0 (success)
}
```

output
```
This process will be terminated now.
```

And to terminate another process, you may call the `kill()` function and pass it the PID of the process you want to kill. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    
    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child process running. PID: %d\n", getpid());
        sleep(10); // Simulate some work
        printf("Child process finishing.\n");
        exit(0);
    } else {
        // Parent process
        sleep(2); // Wait for a moment
        printf("Parent process terminating child with PID: %d\n", pid);
        kill(pid, SIGTERM); // Send a terminating signal (SIGTERM) to the child
        wait(NULL); // Wait for the child process to finish
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
Child process running. PID: 41932
Parent process terminating child with PID: 41932
```

As you can see, the kill happened before the child could have completed its task. Therefore, the rest of the code in the child process did not run. If we comment out the kill function you will see a different output which will make the parent wait unit the child completes its task without interruption.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    
    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child process running. PID: %d\n", getpid());
        sleep(10); // Simulate some work
        printf("Child process finishing.\n");
        exit(0);
    } else {
        // Parent process
        sleep(2); // Wait for a moment
        printf("Parent process is not terminating the child with PID: %d\n", pid);
        //kill(pid, SIGTERM); // Send a terminating signal (SIGTERM) to the child
        wait(NULL); // Wait for the child process to finish
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
Child process running. PID: 42147
Parent process is not terminating the child with PID: 42147
Child process finishing.
```

> Note: The wait(NULL) function in C is used to make a parent process wait for one of its child processes to terminate.

> Note: SIGTERM (Signal Terminate) is a signal used in Unix-like operating systems to request the termination of a process.

<!-- #### Execute Another Process by Calling it from our Program -->

#### Execute Another Process 
We have seen earlier how can we create a process and run through the use of `fork` syscall. However, we will not always create processes, we might just use another process/program by calling it from our app. For example, calling `date` program. To do so, we will use `system` function to execute shell commands (which are eventually small programs) as follows. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // To include system()

int main() {
    // Execute the date command
    int result = system("date");

    // Check if the command was successful
    if (result == -1) {
        perror("Error executing date command"); //print error message
        return 0;
    }

    return 1; // Return success
}
```

output

### More examples in Java

#### Create a Process

Create a program that runs the `date` process and display its output.
```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.lang.Process;
import java.lang.ProcessBuilder;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {

            Process p = new ProcessBuilder("date").start(); //Create a process to run date program
            BufferedReader bfr = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream())); //Read the process output data as an input
            String line = bfr.readLine();
            while (line  != null) { //Loop through the process output and print it until it is finished
                System.out.println(line);
                line = bfr.readLine();
            }
            System.out.println(p.exitValue());
            
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

    }
    
}

```

#### Read a Process

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.lang.Process;
import java.lang.ProcessBuilder;

// Get the information of date process.
public class ProcessInfo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {

            Process p = new ProcessBuilder("date").start(); //Create a process to run date program
            BufferedReader bfr = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream())); //Read the process output data as an input
            String line = bfr.readLine();
            while (line  != null) { //Loop through the process output and print it until it is finished
                System.out.println(line);
                line = bfr.readLine();
            }
            System.out.println(p.pid());
            System.out.println(p.isAlive());
            System.out.println(p.exitValue());

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

    }
    
}

```

#### Terminate a Process

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.lang.Process;
import java.lang.ProcessBuilder;

// Terminate a process using destroy method.
public class ProcessTerminate {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {

            Process p = new ProcessBuilder("java", "--version").start(); //Create a process to run date program
            BufferedReader bfr = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream())); //Read the process output data as an input
            String line = bfr.readLine();
            while (line  != null) { //Loop through the process output and print it until it is finished
                System.out.println(line);
                line = bfr.readLine();
            }
            System.out.println(p.pid());
            System.out.println("Is alive before termination: " + p.isAlive());
            p.destroy();
            System.out.println("Is alive after termination: " + p.isAlive());
            System.out.println(p.exitValue());

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

    }
    
}
