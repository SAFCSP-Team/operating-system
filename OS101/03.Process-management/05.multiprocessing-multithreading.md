# Multiprocessing and Multithreading
Creating processes and threads may and may not enhance the program or computer performance. It mainly depends on how you use them.

## Multiprocessing
Multiprocessing means running several processes concurrently.

## Multithreading
Multithreading is the process of creating multiple threads of a process to execute several functionalities concurrently.

## Concurrency 
Concurrency is the ability to execute more than one task at the same time; To utilize hardware resources, and speed up the execution process. It can be concluded using multiprocessing or multithreading concepts.

## Context Switching
Context switching is the process of switching a running process or thread to another in the CPU.

Note that, switching between processes or threads which is called context switching is costly. Switching a running process will require a complete snapshot of the current state of the process execution and all its related data, which will be stored as a PCB (Process Control Block). Once the CPU is ready to execute the previously removed process, it will load all of its information and resume its execution. Context switching is time-consuming and costly, that is why you should apply multiprocessing and multithreading wisely.
