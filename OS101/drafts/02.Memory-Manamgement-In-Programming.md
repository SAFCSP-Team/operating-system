# Memory Management in Programming

## Memory Management from Programmer Perspective 
Operating System manages memory by allocating and deallocating spaces when needed. It also loads programs as processes when they are executed. From our part as programmers, we need to understand how can we make the usage of memory efficient by understanding how programs are mapped and stored in the memory.

## The life cycle of the process in the memory
Programs are stored permanently in the Disk. When you click on a program, the OS will load that program in Main Memory so the CPU can read and execute the program instructions by directly reading and writing into the main memory. 

When the OS loads a program into main memory, it will allocated memory addresses 

## Terminologies  
- **Memory allocation**: It means storing data in memory when the programs need to. Allocation can happen in compile time & run time. 
- **Memory deallocation**: Means releasing or freeing memory spaces to be used again. 
- **Garbage collector**: is a feature in some programming languages such as Java and Python. It scans the memory and reclaims the no longer needed addresses. Note that garbage collector runs at runtime.


> Note: there is an issue called **memory leak**, it happens when an allocated memory address is no longer needed but was not deallocated. It decreases the performance of the computer since there is less space to be used in the memory.
