# I/O Management 

## I/O Abstraction
Most operating systems including Unix like systems and Windows, handles and sees hardware devices integrating with the computer **as files**. Which means accessing devices and requesting read/write operations on them is the same as read/write operations done to files. This approach enhances standardization and simplifies communication with hardware devices attached.

## How does File Abstraction Works on I/O Devices
Integrating a new device into your computer involves several steps. First, you need to plug in the device (e.g., printer, USB drive, external hard drive) into the computer using the appropriate port (USB, HDMI, etc.).

Once the device is connected, the operating system detects it and represents it as a file or a set of files (for example, disk drives appear as file systems). After the device is recognized, applications can access it using standard file operations such as `open`, `read`, `write`, and `close`., allowing for seamless interaction with the device.


### Conclusion

By treating devices as files, operating systems simplify the interaction between applications and hardware. This abstraction allows developers to use familiar file I/O operations while enabling the OS to manage devices efficiently and securely. This approach enhances usability and promotes consistency across different types of interactions with both physical and virtual devices.

> Note: The name `File I/O` mirrors the concept of handling I/O devices as files since both uses the same syscalls.

## Standard Input and Output
Standard input and output are the default devices set to present output or take input. Typically, they are referred to as standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and there is also standard error (stderr).

Normally, each standard I/O stream is connected to a device:

- **stdin**: Usually the keyboard.
- **stdout**: Typically the monitor (console).
- **stderr**: Also typically the monitor (console), used specifically for error messages.


In programming languages, there are functions that read from and write to these standard I/O streams:

- **stdin**: Functions like `scanf` in C or `input()` in Python are used to read data from stdin.
- **stdout**: Functions like `printf` in C or `print()` in Python are used to send data to stdout.
- **stderr**: Functions like `fprintf(stderr, ...) `in C or using `print()` with a file object in Python can send data to stderr.

## Code

### Standard I/O

#### stdin
The program prompts the user to enter an integer, which is then read and displayed.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;
    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);
    printf("You entered: %d\n", number);
    return 0;
}
```

#### stdout
The program prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

#### stderr
An error message is printed to standard error, which can be redirected separately from standard output.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: Something went wrong!\n");
    return 1;  // Return a non-zero value to indicate an error
}
```
