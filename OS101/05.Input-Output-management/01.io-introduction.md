# Input and Output Introduction 
Computers are designed to process input and produce output. To achieve this, it needs to get these input from users via an input device and produce an output via an output device. Thus, input and output devices can be thought as the communication method between the computer and the outside world.

> Note: both input and output devices are hardware components.

## What are input devices? 
Input devices are responsible to deliver the input which can be data or commands from users to the computer.They serve as the interface between the user and the computer, enabling the computer to receive information for processing.

### Examples
 - Microphone 
 - Keyboard
 - Mouse 


## What are output devices? 
Output devices are hardware components that convey information from the computer to the users. They convert processed data into a form that is understandable to humans depending on the output device type.

### Examples
- Screen / Monitor
- Speaker
- Projector
- Headphones



## User and Kernel Levels 
A fundamental concept in operating systems is the user level and kernel level and the distinction between them. These levels differ based on the privileges each level has, OS is after all a process that controls other processes and the computer as whole. To achieve this, it needs complete control over the computer and its resources including memory, CPU and input/output devices. 

User level is where user programs gets executed, they don't need to access other processes data or control the computer. As a result, they operate with limited privileges compared to the operating system (OS run in the kernel level/space).


> Note: the user and kernel space are execution context where kernel has complete privileges and the user has limited privileges to execute.

### Why having User and Kernel Levels?
The separation of the execution contexts (user and kernel), help to secure the computer from malware programs and stabilize it by ensuring a failure in one process will not affect the computer in whole. Also, it provide abstraction to user programs for easier communication and utilization of computer resources.


## How do I/O Devices Works?
When a user program needs an I/O device, it will request to access it from the operating system. Then, the execution context will be switch from user mode to kernel mode so the operating system can run and access the device for the user program to complete its task.
Once the resource has been used and the os finishes its task, the control will be given back to the user program after switching to user mode.

Here are the steps to request access to I/O device,
| **Step** | **Description**  |
|----------|------------------|
| Request Access    | It all starts when a user program sends a request to the operating system to get access to a specific I/O device. This is done through system calls. |
| Context Switch   | Next, the system switches from user mode to kernel mode. This transition is crucial because it gives the operating system the necessary privileges to handle the hardware. |
| Device Access     | Now, the operating system takes over communication with the I/O device, sending commands and managing the data transfer between the device and the program. |
| Completion of Task | Once the operation is finished, the operating system wraps up any related tasks, ensuring everything is in order. |
| Return Control   | Finally, control goes back to the user program by switching back to user mode, allowing it to continue running with the results from the I/O operation. |

TO DO 
- Device drivers? what are they? 
- What syscalls are used to access I/O devices?
- The abstraction of I/O devices as files.
