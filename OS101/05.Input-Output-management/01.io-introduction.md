# Input and Output Introduction 
Computers are designed to process input and produce output. To achieve this, it needs to get these input from users via an input device and produce an output via an output device. Thus, input and output devices can be thought as the communication method between the computer and the outside world.

> Note: both input and output devices are hardware components.

## What are input devices? 
Input devices are responsible to deliver the input which can be data or commands from users to the computer. They serve as the interface between the user and the computer, enabling the computer to receive data for processing.

### Examples
 - Microphone 
 - Keyboard
 - Mouse 


## What are output devices? 
Output devices are hardware components that convey information from the computer to the users. They convert processed data into a form that is understandable to humans depending on the output device type.

### Examples
- Screen / Monitor
- Speaker
- Projector
- Headphones


## Device Drivers 
An important concept regarding I/O devices is that each device has a specialized type of software called a device driver. This driver explains how the operating system can communicate with the device.

Since the early development of computers, hardware devices have been produced in large quantities. To avoid the complexity of instructing the computer to handle every newly produced device individually, drivers were developed. These drivers allow devices to connect to the computer by following the standards provided by the operating system for communication. This setup enables devices to operate when a system call triggers their execution. It is the responsibility of hardware manufacturers to develop these drivers.

> Note: Device drivers translate generic OS commands into device-specific instructions, allowing the OS to communicate with a wide variety of hardware.

## User and Kernel Levels 
A fundamental concept in operating systems is the user level and kernel level and the distinction between them. These levels differ based on the privileges each level has, OS is after all a process that controls other processes and the computer as whole. To achieve this, it needs complete control over the computer and its resources including memory, CPU and input/output devices. 

User level is where user programs gets executed, they don't need to access other processes data or control the computer. As a result, they operate with limited privileges compared to the operating system (OS run in the kernel level/space).


> Note: the user and kernel space are execution context where kernel has complete privileges and the user has limited privileges to execute.

### Why having User and Kernel Levels?
The separation of the execution contexts (user and kernel), help to secure the computer from malware programs and stabilize it by ensuring a failure in one process will not affect the computer in whole. Also, it provide abstraction to user programs for easier communication and utilization of computer resources.


## How do I/O Devices Works?
When a user program needs an I/O device, it will request to access it from the operating system. Then, the execution context will be switch from user mode to kernel mode so the operating system can run and access the device for the user program to complete its task.
Once the resource has been used and the os finishes its task, the control will be given back to the user program after switching to user mode.

Here are the steps to request access to I/O device,
| **Step** | **Description**  |
|----------|------------------|
| Request Access    | It all starts when a user program sends a request to the operating system to get access to a specific I/O device. This is done through system calls. |
| Context Switch   | Next, the system switches from user mode to kernel mode. This transition is crucial because it gives the operating system the necessary privileges to handle the hardware. |
| Device Access     | Now, the operating system takes over communication with the I/O device, sending commands and managing the data transfer between the device and the program. |
| Completion of Task | Once the operation is finished, the operating system wraps up any related tasks, ensuring everything is in order. |
| Return Control   | Finally, control goes back to the user program by switching back to user mode, allowing it to continue running with the results from the I/O operation. |

THIS PART NEEDS AN EXPLANATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CONTROL FLOW BEFORE IT.

## How to Request I/O 
When a program is requesting data from a file, there is a syscall to use which is read syscall. This call will request to access data on the disk (which is the file content). Operating system then runs on kernel mode to handle this request, once it is done, it will send a signal called interrupt to the CPU, which will be checked after each instruction processing to check of there is a signal from an I/O device. If the interrupt signal is set, the control will be given to the interrupt handler...   -->






## How do I/O Requests Handled
To explain how requests are handled, we need to understand the concept of Exceptional Control Flow (ECF), which refers to the control of the execution flow in a computer. Ideally, computers execute instructions sequentially, one after another. However, depending on the computer's state, there are times when we need to stop the current instruction due to an error, a hardware fault, or the need to execute another instruction.

Depending on the reason, control may be transferred from a program running in user mode to the operating system, which runs in kernel mode, to handle the situation.

Exceptional Control Flow can be classified into the following categories:

**Interrupt**: Occurs when an I/O device completes its task by sending an interrupt signal to the processor, signaling that the data is ready.
**Trap (syscall)**: A mechanism for a program to request a service from the operating system.
**Fault**: An unexpected condition that occurs during instruction execution, often related to issues like invalid memory access.
**Abort**: A severe error that causes the execution to be halted, often requiring a system reset.

[Maybe adding images of each ECF will help explaining the concept]
