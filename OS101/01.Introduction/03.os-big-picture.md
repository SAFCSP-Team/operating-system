# OS the big picture 
To better understand the computer and how OS manage resources, we would like to start explaining the **big picture**. which explains how does the OS make use of HW resources to execute programs. 

## Program Lifecycle
The program in its life time, is going to walk through several stages. 
1. Source Code
2. Executable File
3. Running Program (Process)

At the start of creating a program, it will be just a **source code** which is a set of instruction written in a specific programming language. When the program is compiled, the **executable file** will be generated. The executable file is stored in the **disk** permanently until the user clicks on it to run. When a program start running, we call it a **Process**.


>  **Process** is a program in execution.


## Computer Hardware Resources
Now we know what is the stages of the program, let us understand how a program gets executed by explaining each resource and its usage. 

### Disk
**Disks are used to store data permanently**, the data will not be lost even if the computer power is turned off. In the view of a program lifecycle, the source file or the executable file will be stored in the disk permanently.

OS manages the disk by the following
- Managing files and directories creation, deletion, updating and retrieving.
- Mapping data to secondly storage (Main Memory).


### Main Memory 
**Main memory is the component that stores temporary data** for quick accesses by the CPU.

When a program icon is clicked by the user, the OS loads the program file from disk as a process in the main memory.

The following is an image of a process structure in main memory.

OS manages main memory by the following.
- allocating and deallocating spaces.
- swapping data between Disk and main memory.
- keep track of every memory block and its usage.


### CPU
The CPU is the processing unit in the computer it is the component that is responsible to execute process's instruction.

OS manages the CPU by deciding which process should run currently and keep track of processes and its state.
