# Memory Management
We have already seen and introduced processes to understand how our programs will be mapped and run. However, from here on we will focus on memory management.
We have already mentioned that the process will be mapped into memory as static and dynamic sections which are, data, code, stack, and heap. In this lesson we will look deeply into what gets stored in each section and how to write programs considering the memory usage to enhance the performance.
