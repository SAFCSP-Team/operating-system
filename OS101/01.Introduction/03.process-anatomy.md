# Process Anatomy
A process is essentially a program that is currently being executed. When a program runs, it is transformed into a process, which is assigned an identifier (ID), a state, memory space, and various other attributes. In this lesson, we will take a closer look at processes and the related data associated with them.


## Process
You can think of a process as a task given to the computer to be performed, to do so the computer needs to understand the information it needs to perform the program. That is why there is a unified form for processes to be mapped to in order to know how to interact with it.
A process in memory will be divided into two sections, static and dynamic. 
The static section will contain the known data such as global variables and the program instructions. Their spaces are is determined from the start at compile time. However, dynamic section will contains the data that are specified at the run time. Such as new objects creation and functions call. 
A process in memory will have data, code and space for heap and stack. Each section holds specific type of data.

The static section contains data and code. which are the variables and constants created, and the code which is the program's instructions. While dynamic section contains the stack and heap which are responsible for holding local variables, function calls, and storing objects until they are deleted.

|Section | Description|
|--------|------------|
| Data   |Data section will contain static and global variables.|
| Code   |Will hold the program instructions.|
| Heap   | Is a free memory space we can use during the program execution (at run time), it is commonly used to store objects that can be freed later on in the execution.|
| Stack  | Will contain temporary variables such as local variables and return addresses that are related to function calls. |


## Process Meta-Data
There are some meta-data the operating system needs to manage process. For example how can the operating system address or refer to a process? Also, some times the process gets interrupted during its execution, how would the operating system knows where did the process stopped? Does the operating system start running the process from the start if it gets interrupted?

These questions will be answered with time, by understanding how OS manages process. However, for now we conclude that the operating system needs some data related to process management. 

|Data | Description|
|--------|------------|
| PID    |Process ID uniquely identifies a process |
| State  ||
| PC     | |
| Stack  | Will contain temporary variables such as local variables and return addresses that are related to function calls. |
