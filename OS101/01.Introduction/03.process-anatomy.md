# Process Anatomy
A process is essentially a program that is currently being executed. When a program runs, it is transformed into a process, which is assigned an identifier (ID), a state, memory space, and various other attributes. In this lesson, we will take a closer look at processes and the related data associated with them.


## Process
You can think of a process as a task given to the computer to be performed, to do so the computer needs to understand the information it needs to perform the program. That is why there is a unified form for processes to be mapped to in order to know how to interact with it.
A process in memory will have data, code and space for heap and stack. Each section holds specific type of data.

**Data**
Data section will contain static data such as global variables and their values.

**Code**
Will hold the program instructions. 

**Heap**
The heap is a free memory space we can use during the program execution, it is commonly used to store objects that can be freed later on in the execution.

**Stack**
function calls and local variables are hold in the stack. When we call  function, the function will be added to the stack space with stack frame. The stack frame is the holder of the function caller, callee and local data.
