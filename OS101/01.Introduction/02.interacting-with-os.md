# Interacting with Operating Systems 
As normal users, we can interact with the OS by user interfaces such as a Graphical User Interface **GUI** when clicking programs and closing them or using the Command Line Interface **CLI**. However, software programs communicate with the OS using System Calls also called **syscalls**. Operating system provides software programs with a list of services they can request to access a resource or do an action which is syscalls. 

Syscalls are used to manage processes, memory, file and much more. And as programmers, we develop software programs. Therefore, we need to understand how to interact with the operating through the use of syscalls in the development phase of a program. 

In the next topics, we will focus on syscalls that are related to memory management, process management and I/O syscalls. But first, we will walkthrough the big picture of how operating systems handle processes. 

> Note: syscalls allows the software programs to access and utilize hardware resources without needing to know the underlying details.

## Program Lifecycle
The program in its life time, is going to walk through several stages. 
1. Source Code
2. Executable File
3. Running Program (Process)

At the start of creating a program, it will be just a **source code** which is a set of instruction written in a specific programming language. When the program is compiled, the **executable file** will be generated. The executable file is stored in the **disk** permanently until the user clicks on it to run. When a program start running, we call it a **Process**.


>  **Process** is a program in execution.
