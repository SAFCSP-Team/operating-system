# Memory Management
Here, we will cover how to manage memory through programming. 


1. What does a class do? + The purpose of struct? both section the block of memory to store data. for example std = [int id, string name, int age ].
2. What is the purpose of data types? each type has a size. + offset example to understand how computers access specific data in an array or object. 
3. Concept of pointers? what are pointers and how to access elements in memory addresses? create an array and use the offset to access elements. + explain the reason that we use data type for pointers to understand the offset we will use when we read the value they store.
4. The concept of malloc & free?
5. What happens if we call a function? stack frame explanation.
6. Why is calling a function in a loop is not recommended? the stack frame gets destroyed and created with each iteration.
